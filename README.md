### _A Tool for Analyzing and Visualizing Repository File Structures and Relationships_

**RepoInsight** is a powerful tool designed to analyze the file structure of GitHub repositories and visualize the relationships between files. It helps developers gain insights into the file system and its dependencies, providing a comprehensive overview of how various components interconnect. RepoInsight focuses on explaining the repository's architecture, file roles, and relationships rather than just giving a code-level explanation.

With a user-friendly front-end built using **Next.js** and a robust back-end powered by **Python Flask**, RepoInsight offers a seamless interface for both casual users and seasoned developers to explore and understand their repositories.

---

## **Key Features**

- **Directory Structure Analysis**: Provides a detailed breakdown of the repository’s folder hierarchy and the purpose of each file and directory.
- **File Role Classification**: Automatically classifies files into categories such as source code, configuration files, documentation, test files, and assets.
- **Dependency Mapping**: Shows how files are connected through imports, requires, includes, and configuration references.
- **Asset Usage Detection**: Identifies how media files like images, fonts, and other resources are used across the project.
- **Build and Configuration File Insights**: Provides analysis of `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `package.json`, and other configuration files to show how they impact the repository.
- **Visual Graph Representation**: Displays relationships between files in an interactive graph to provide a holistic view of the repository.
- **Multi-Language Support**: Currently supports analyzing repositories in Python, JavaScript, and more.

---

## **Architecture**

**RepoInsight** leverages a **Next.js** front-end to provide an intuitive UI for users to upload and analyze repositories. The back-end, built with **Python Flask**, handles file parsing, dependency analysis, and relationship mapping.

### **Frontend: Next.js**

- Provides an interactive dashboard to explore file structure and relationships.
- Receives user input (such as a GitHub repository URL) and sends it to the backend for processing.
- Displays visual representations of the file system and relationships using libraries like **D3.js** or **Graphviz**.

### **Backend: Python Flask**

- Fetches and processes repository data.
- Recursively scans and categorizes files based on their types.
- Analyzes import and dependency relationships using language-specific parsers (e.g., Python’s `ast`, JavaScript regex, etc.).
- Maps configuration files and their impact on the source code (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `requirements.txt`, `package.json`).
- Communicates results back to the frontend for display.

## **Getting Started**

Follow these instructions to set up and run **RepoInsight** on your local machine.

### **Prerequisites**

1. **Node.js** and **npm/yarn** installed for Next.js frontend.
2. **Python 3.7+** installed for the Flask backend.
3. **Git** for cloning repositories.
4. **Graphviz** (optional but recommended) for generating file relationship graphs.

### **Installation**

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/repoinsight.git
   cd repoinsight
   ```

2. **Install Frontend Dependencies (Next.js)**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install  # or yarn install
   ```

3. **Install Backend Dependencies (Flask)**
   ```bash
   cd ../backend
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

### **Running the Application**

1. **Start the Flask Backend**

   ```bash
   cd backend
   flask run
   ```

   This will start the Flask API server on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`.

2. **Start the Next.js Frontend**

   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm run dev  # or yarn dev
   ```

   This will start the frontend on `http://localhost:3000/`.

3. **Access the Application**  
   Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to start analyzing repositories.

---

## **Usage**

1. **Upload a GitHub Repository**:  
   Enter the GitHub repository URL you want to analyze in the provided input field and hit "Analyze."

2. **View Directory Structure**:  
   Once analyzed, you’ll see a tree-like structure showing all the directories and files in the repository, along with detailed explanations of each file's role.

3. **Explore File Relationships**:  
   A visual graph will be generated showing the dependencies between files (e.g., which files import or include other files).

4. **Inspect Configuration and Build Files**:  
   Configuration files like `Dockerfile`, `Makefile`, `package.json`, and `requirements.txt` will be parsed, showing how they impact the codebase and build process.

---

## **File Classification**

RepoInsight classifies files into the following categories:

- **Source Code**: Core application code, such as Python files (`.py`), JavaScript files (`.js`), etc.
- **Configuration Files**: Files that define application settings or dependencies (`.json`, `.yml`, `Dockerfile`, etc.).
- **Documentation**: Files that describe the project (`README.md`, `LICENSE`, etc.).
- **Assets**: Media files like images, fonts, and icons.
- **Test Files**: Files used for testing the application.

Each of these categories is provided with an explanation, allowing users to understand their purpose within the project.

---

## **Visualizing File Relationships**

RepoInsight uses an advanced analysis engine to map file dependencies. The following relationships are identified and visualized:

- **Imports/Includes**: How one file imports modules or libraries from another.
- **Asset Usage**: How assets like images are referenced in HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.
- **Build Configuration**: How build-related files (e.g., `Dockerfile`, `package.json`) tie into the project.

These relationships are displayed in a **graph format**, making it easy to understand the internal architecture of the repository.
